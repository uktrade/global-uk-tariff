    <p class="govuk-body">This online service is run by the Department for International Trade. We want as many people as possible to be able to use it. For example, that means you should be able to:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
        <li>zoom in up to 150% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
        <li>navigate the service using just a keyboard</li>
        <li>use the service with and without JavaScript</li>
        <li>listen to the service in full using a screen reader (including recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
        <li>navigate the whole service, including links, using speech recognition software</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">We've also made the text as simple as possible to understand.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-l" id="about-the-accessibility-of-this-service">About the accessibility of this service</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">We used components in the GOV.UK Design System to build this service. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/accessibility/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">Design System accessibility guide</a> explains the current state of accessibility for these components.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">We have completed a full WCAG 2.1 audit for this online service and have updated this statement in response to the findings.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Parts of this website are not fully accessible. For example:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>some links and custom components on the site are not accessible to screen readers and speech recognition software</li>
        <li>the text will not reflow in a single column when you change the size of the browser window</li>
        <li>when JavaScript is enabled, search and filter elements automatically update the content or layout of the page without notifying the user</li>
        <li>some navigation features in the pagination rely on visual placement of content</li>
        <li>modal boxes and download buttons rely on visual clues to indicate when they have been selected</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">We are actively working to fix these issues during regular service updates, with the aim of completing this work by December 2020.</p>
